# RaspberryPi_pico_distance_measure
This project measures distance using an ultrasonic sensor with a Raspberry Pi Pico. The sensor sends a sound wave and calculates the time taken for it to bounce back, using the Trig and Echo pins. A C program computes the distance in centimeters, which is displayed via USB output in a software called putty.
